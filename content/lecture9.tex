\subsection*{Mean payoff games}
Adam and Eve play on a weighted graph (negative weights also occur). The play ends
once one vertex has been visited twice (there has occurred a loop). The score of the
game is the mean of the weights \textbf{only} on the loop. Eve wants to maximize the
score, Adam - to minimize. The game is of course determined.
