$G^{++}$\\
$\{0, 1, ..., n\}^{k+1} \approx k+1\text{-digit numbers in base }n+1$\\
Overflow = $(n+1)^{k+1}$\\

\noindent
$\textbf{up}(2i+1, \underbrace{a_0a_1a_2...a_k}_{m}) = m + (n+1)^{i}$\\
$\textbf{up}(2i, a_0a_1...a_k) = 0...0a_ia_{i+1}...a_k$\\

\noindent
$G^{++}$ is equivalent to $G$ (i.e. if Adam has winning strategy in $G$, he has
a winning strategy in $G++$)
